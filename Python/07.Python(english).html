            <pre class="english">Wow you are very consistent. I did not thaught that you would reach lecture seven. but Congrats.
because today we are learning a very fun thing. Loops

Types of loops in Python:
1) for loops
2) while loops
3) nested loop (means a loop inside a loop inside a loop inside a loop inside a loop..)
            </pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english hilightPur">now in first Lecture i said something about printing 100000000 numbers automatically.
Lets see an example of for loop first and understand it.

<pre class='code'>
<code>
i = 0    
for(i&lt;100):       <b class='comments'>#this is basic syntax of for loop. now, "for" here is a keyword. "i" here is a variable. what this line means to say is hey python enter this loop. and check the condition. keep running to code inside of loop again and again until condition gets wrong </b> 
    print(i)         <b class='comments'># now Python whil check the condition is 0 is less than 100 which is true so it will run the code and print the value of i which is currently zero.</b>
    i = i + 1        <b class='comments'># now to increase the value of i we say that python, take value of i and add one to i. this will now make i = 1 and the loop will run again</b>

<b class='comments'># the loop will run again and i will increase again. we call this increase, to increment. we are adding 1 to i so we are incrementing i with 1. 
now eventually i will reach the value of 2 and 3 and 4 all the way to 100. and when it reaches 100, 100 is  not less than 100 so condition is false Python will know to exit the loop.
</b>
<b class='comments'># Now if you dont increment i, the value of i will never increase, it will not ever reach 100 and stay zero always. which will cause Python to keep running the loop forever.until you close the program.
it is not recommended to run an infinite loop like that since it uses your ram which will eventually reach its limit and your program will crash.

<pre class='code'>
<code>
for i in range(0,100, 1):   <b class='comments'># now this creates a new variable i and says to Python the hey, check the valur of i from all the numbers between 0 and 100. Python will say yes. and run the code between this for loop keeping the value of i = 0 first
run the code and go back to the top to change the value of i to 2 and then all the way upto 99. wait 99? yes since 100 is not less than 100 so it stops at 99.
</b>
<b class='comments'># You might say what is the third argument about?. well its the iteration argument. it tells Python how many number to add in i to change its value. the default is 1 so even if you dont put the third argument Python will understand that its 1.</b>
    print(i)

    <b class='comments'># keep in note that you can not use this variable i anywhere else out of the loop. because its a local variable and is bound to the for loop only.</b>

            <pre class="english">Now while loop takes a boolean value (True or False) . so we can also write like

for i in trait:         <b class='comments'># now the list trait here, gives i range of elements in the list trait. so while running the program i will have values stored in trait one by one.</b>
    <b class='comments'># firstly i will have it value as "big"</b> 
    for j in noun:   <b class='comments'># we created another variable that store value of noun one by one</b>

            <b class="Name">Jeena: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">ok. so the break keyword is used in a loop and it creak the loop completely and work as a door for python to come out of the loop. like breaking out of the loop.

<pre class='code'>
<code>
for i in range(0,4):
    print(i)
    if(i==2):
        break      <b class='comments'># when i is 2 meaning the condition is true and the break will be executed. Python will come out of the loop without any more iterations.</b>

</code>
</pre><br>

OUTPUT:

<pre class='OUTPUT'>
0
1
2

</pre>

we got the break statement now, what continue statement do?
continue statement forces the loop to stop everything it is doing ad move on to the next iteration.
suppose you have 5 lines of code inside a loop and there is a continue statement at the 2nd line. so when python reaches line 2, it will stop everything and moves on to next iteration of the loop which means that the lines after continue staement will not be executed


<pre class='code'>
<code>
for i in range(0,5):
    print("printing for first time ", i)
    if(i==3):
        continue
    print("printing for second time.", i)

<pre class='OUTPUT'>
printing for first time  0
printing for second time. 0
printing for first time  1
printing for second time. 1
printing for first time  2

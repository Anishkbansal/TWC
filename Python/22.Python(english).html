            <pre class="english">An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that specify how different software components should interact with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that enables communication and data exchange between different software applications or systems.
APIs define the methods, data formats, and conventions that should be followed by developers when requesting services or resources from an application or system. They provide a structured way for applications to access and leverage the functionality or data of another application or service without needing to know the underlying implementation details.

<b class='comments'># example 1</b>
Imagine you're at a restaurant, and you want to order food. The waiter is the API (Application Programming Interface) that acts as a messenger between you and the kitchen. You tell the waiter what you want, and the waiter takes that order to the kitchen. The kitchen is like the system or service that actually prepares the food.
The waiter doesn't cook the food themselves; they just communicate your order to the kitchen and bring the prepared food back to you. Similarly, an API doesn't perform the actual tasks or services; it just acts as an intermediary that takes requests from an application or client and passes them to the appropriate system or service that can fulfill those requests.

<b class='comments'># example 2</b>
let's say you're using a weather app on your phone. When you ask the app for the current weather in your location, the app doesn't have the weather data itself. Instead, it sends a request to a weather service's API, which then retrieves the weather data from the weather service's systems and sends it back to the app. The app then displays the weather information to you.
So, in this scenario, the weather app is the client, the weather service's API is the intermediary or messenger, and the weather service's systems are the ones that actually have and provide the weather data.
APIs allow different software systems to communicate and share data with each other, making it easier to build complex applications by integrating various services and functionalities.

            <pre class="english">the transfer of data happen in the wire formats but processing is handeled by api.(when to send, waht to do,what to send,where to send etc) 
api are ways of communicating..   <b>data is transfered by api in form of wire formats (json xml etc)</b>

now api is used for processing data sent, data recieved. etc.  service layer is used to process that data. check its validity etc.


api are just interfaces.

<b>if you dont understand what api's are dont worry just know that they are something let lets you transfer data and communicate with the service.</b>

Now there are companies that put up public api and sell those. 
we will explore anthropic api which the parent company of ai claude.
they you you 5 dollars for testing for free. you need to pay after that.

            <pre class="english">Now i want all of you to hop on your pc screen and actually try these. experiment on these. failure is best way to learn. if you have any trouble i am here to teach. also did you get the feeel about API? comment your feedback</pre><br>

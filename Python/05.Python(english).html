            <pre
                class="english">just like this the Conditionals in Python are that easy. lets have a look at the syntax
<pre class="code">
<code>
if(56+13&gt;106):     <pre class="comments"># if, just like we know, means if. in the brackets, it takes arguments that return boolean value. we studies that &gt; operator return boolean.and a colon at the end ':'</pre>
            print(56+13, "is greater than ", 106)
            <pre
                class="comments"># if the condition in if statement inside the brackets is True, then, all the code under if statement will be executed.
and did you notice that there is some space before the print statement here, well thats called indentation. its our way of telling Python that the code belongs to the if statement</pre>

            else:
            <pre
                class="comments"># if the argument of if statement is False, then the else statement will be executed. in Python, the else statement is completely Optional.</pre>
            print(56+13 ," is not greater than. ", 136)

            </code>
            </pre><br />

            OUTPUT:

            <pre class="OUTPUT">

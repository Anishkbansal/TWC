            <pre class="english">Vs Code is a videly used IDE. an IDE mean integrated development enviroment It is a software application that provides a consolidated platform for programmers to write, test, and debug code (debugging means finding errors in code and fixing it).
well Vs Code is used to create so many programs. this lecture was also made using VsCode. you know you can even code in Python using your notepad i.e your window's notes software or Python's inbuilt IDE. but it will be a lot difficult and why not make our lives easier by using more advanced IDE.

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">First up, I am not your bro second Installing VSCode is a breeze let me show you.

            <pre
                class="english">2) Now depending on your system choose the button. for mac, choose the third button 
for linux, click 2nd button and for windows, click 1st button which is also hilighted in the button. now, the website will automatically download the latest version as per your software. </pre>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre
                class="english">3) Now open the installed package/setup. -&gt; read the terms and conditions, accept them, and click next.</pre>

            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre
                class="english">4) Now check the boxes as shown in the image. and dont forget to check the box "add to Path". and click next</pre>
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="images" src="Image resource/DownloadVsCode/4. install VsCode.png" /><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre class="english">5) Click on install</pre><br />
            <img alt="" class="images" src="Image resource/DownloadVsCode/5. install VsCode.png" /><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre
                class="english">6) now go to any folder where you want to save your code. preferable not to put it in C: drive. after navigating to folder, right click and choose the option open with code.This will open vsCode in that folder. This folder is now called Directory.</pre>
            <br />
            <img alt="" class="images" src="Image resource/DownloadVsCode/6. install VsCode.png" /><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre class="english">7) Now, in the left side of your screen you will see the Directory details.which shows what folders, files, images etc are present in your folder. 
-- the red arrow in the image down here is pointing to a button which looks like a folder. click that button to create new folder in the directory. name the folder. and done. 
-- the yellow arrow in the image down here is pointing to a button which looks like a document (file). click that button to create new file. a file can be anything, a python file, an image, a text file, etc.
-- now we want to create a new file, so we click the 'add file' button (being pointed by the yellow arrow).

            <img alt="" class="images" src="Image resource/DownloadVsCode/7. install VsCode.png" /><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre class="english">8) After clicking you would have to type name of your file. now if you type anything it will work. but it might not create correct type of file. 
for that, you need correct extension type. now extension is what comes after the dot i.e (.) or full-stop. there are many types of extension, for images the most common are (.svg, .png, .jpg etc) for videos(.mp4, .avi etc) for text file (.txt) is used. i hope you have heard of them.
for python files, there is also an extension i.e (.py) . like in the image here, i create a fille Hello.py . where hello is name of file which can be anything. (even agsegf.). but it is recomended to avoid any spaces. like (my first program) name of file becomes (my_first_program   or  MyFirstProgram) etc.
now back to file i created, you will notice that after Hello, there is .py written. yes, that is the python extension.

its a way of saying to computer that hey computer, create a new file. i will name it Hello. and i am writing .py after hello so you must know that its a python file.
and you are off to next step now

            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre class="english">9) Now vsCode is just a tool used by majority, there are many tool you can use to code in python or other languages like pycharm, atom, notepad (yes notepad). etc
Now to use VsCode with Python, we need an extension tool for that. no no this is not file extension its extension that means tools that helps you easy your workflow. like chrome extensions etc. 
ENGLISH IS CONFUSING LANGUAGE. 
so go to extension window (window means the screen that is being shown on your pc currently) which is hilighted with blue box in the image below. it would look like 4 boxes forming a square and top-right box little missplaced. 
yes click that and search Python. Click on the first extension by microsoft and install it.

            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre class="english">10) now you can go back to your file secion that looks like two documents and is present on top in the left panel. and click on the python file you created.
now write any code you like (if you can't understand code in the image dont worry that what we are going to learn). now click on the play button .red arrow is pointing towards play button. and click that.
</pre><br />
            <img alt="" class="images" src="Image resource/DownloadVsCode/10. install VsCode.png" /><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo:</b><br />
            <pre class="english">11) clicking the run button should run your code in the terminal. which is at the bottom. now there are more things you can see in vs code window like file, edit, selection.... option at the top but dont worry. that is not scope of this lecture but we will eventually learn them.
Thanks

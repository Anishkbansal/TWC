            <pre class="english">lets get started right away</pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">well we have already studied about strings in previous lectures like f-string, some string methods etc. which we will discuss here also. with some code
well what was need of reading about strings different from other datatypes? because strings are different.  the String behaves as a List of characters joined like beads. anything inside quotes, is a string.

<pre class='code'>
<code>
str1  = "this is a string"
str2 = 'this is also a string'
str3 = '''this is a multiline string'''

<b class='comments'># Jenna: So, Peepo, strings are like sentences we say every day, but inside quotes?</b>
<b class='comments'># Peepo: exactly</b>

<b class='comments'># lets move to some basic string operations.</b>

<b class='comments'># since string are iterable and immutable(this thing is different from list). and behaves almost like a list. we can do slicing of a string like a fruit.</b>

s = "Hello      I am / Peepo, i hope / must be having a exciting [] learning curve and please take a break after this lecture"
print(s[4] , "is 4th index of string s")
print(s[1:8], "is 1 to 7th index of string s")

<b class='comments'># Einstein: what if we access index that does not exist?</b>
<b class='comments'># Peepo: you will get an index error. trying to get something that does not exists. Python will be lost finding that dont be cruel for Python.</b>

print("length of string is", len(s))
print("IN LOWERCASE: ", s.lower())  <b class='comments'># turns all characters in string to lowerCase</b>
print("in uppercase: ", s.upper())  <b class='comments'># turns all characters in string to upperCase</b>

s.strip()  <b class='comments'># you can strip of string of unwanted peices of characters.üò≥poor string. the strip method takes an argument and if none provided. it just strips the whitespaces i.e empty spaces like                      &lt;- this</b>
s.strip(" / ") <b class='comments'># you can also provide multiple string characters without any spaces . add space for your convenience</b>
s.strip(" . [] ") <b class='comments'># this is a dot, square brackets. removes whitespace even then.</b>


print("if Peepo is replaced with Einstein, this string will be, " s.replace("Peepo", "einstein")) <b class='comments'># replace() takes two arguments, the first one is what you wantt to replace in string and second is what you want in its place instead</b>
l = "     Love You       "
print(l.replace(" ", "‚ù§Ô∏è"))  <b class='comments'># notice first argument is just one space/whitespace</b>


<b class='comments'># The split() method is like a pair of scissors that can cut this long string into smaller pieces wherever you tell it to cut</b>
<b class='comments'># If you don't tell it where to cut, it will cut the string wherever there are spaces. So, if you do</b>

print("strip func without any argument: ", s.strip()) <b class='comments'># it strips by whitespace and forms a list of seperated words</b>
<b class='comments'># lets make a shorter string for ease of teaching</b>
xs = "hello students i am Peepo"
print("strip func on xs string with argument  = 'o' : ", xs.strip("o"))
o_strip_xs = xs.strip("o")
print("to strip by individual characters, use empty string as argument " , xs.strip(""))

<b class='comments'># now we have a list of cutted string. suppose we are editing a paragraph given by user or trying to count no of words. or trying to edit string using list methods. this is useful. </b>
<b class='comments'># an intresting project is to reverse the string like string is "Talk With Computer" and convert it to "retupmoC htiC klaT" or "Computer With Talk" </b>

<b class='comments'># now we have a list cutout from string. and we performed actions we wanted. and now we want string back to be a string.</b>
<b class='comments'># there is join function for that</b>
print("string after joining now, " , "".join(o_strip_xs)) <b class='comments'># the argument of join is what string you want to join.</b>
<b class='comments'># Einstein: what does that string before join means???.</b>
<b class='comments'># good you are attentive. (why am i being a typical teacher huh!) ... this is the string you want in between your list item while joining them. did'nt understand? lets use ecample</b>

l1= ["hello", "i", "am", "Brook"]
print( "".join(l1)) <b class='comments'># python will first try to join first two strings.but it is not intelligent like us to know to put a space between words. it will put whatever it is told to.</b>
<b class='comments'># so if empty string is given it wont put anythin between and output = helloiamBrook</b>
<b class='comments'># if you put a space </b>
print(" ".join(l1)) <b class='comments'># output: hello i am Brook</b>
print(" join ".join(l1)) <b class='comments'># hello join i join am join Brook</b>
print("üòé".join(l1)) <b class='comments'># output: helloüòéiüòéamüòéBrook</b>
<b class='comments'># i hope you understand. if you dont, either you will understand by experience or use ai to write code that might use this method</b>

<b class='comments'># Einstein: Peepo, if we can write everything using AI, then what is our need of learning Programming.  oh i know.i need to attend the AI course for that?</b>
<b class='comments'># Peepo: exxactly. like in previous part, i(an AI robot) was not available but still you taught very well einstein.</b>

            <pre class="english hilightB">this is it. now lets do sets real quick

sets are simple thing. it is like list where no item can repeat iselft like list =[0,0,0,5,4,0]  set = {0,5,4}  each item is unique in a set

Einstein: lol its not a set it looks like a tuple with curly braces. Peepo your brain is damaged.

Peepo: dont ever talk to me like that again. you will regret your every decision.  yes there is some difference. lets disscus it first.


1. sets are mutable .
2. set does not have any sequence like dictionary
3. no item can be repeated. no duplicates. unique characters.
4. represented using curly braces.
5. mathematic operations like intersection, union etc can be used
6. set() function can be used to convert list, tuple etc to set
7. usually used to eliminate duplicate item from a data.
8. Membership Testing: Check for membership in a collection efficiently.

<pre class='code'>
<code>
s1 = {1,2,3, "hello"}
s2 = {3,4,5,6,6} <b class='comments'># i repeated 6 here but while you run the code. python will automaticallly merge the two sixes into one six</b>
list = [45,5,8,4,5,7,8,"hello", "hello"]
s3 = set(list)
s1.add(4) 
s1.add(1)  <b class='comments'># it already exists so it does nothing it wont create new item</b>
s1.remove(2)

<pre class="comments"> union operator is reperesented by     |   </pre>
print(s1 | s2)  <b class='comments'># combines both the sets without any duplication.</b>

<b class='comments'># intersection operator is represented by    &    (its not and symbol in python and is written as and only. )</b>
print(s1 & s2)  <b class='comments'># return the item which is commen in both of them.</b>

print(s1-s2)  <b class='comments'># removes items of s2 from s1. if any</b>
print(s2-s1)  <b class='comments'># removes items of s1 from s2. if any</b>

<b class='comments'># frozen set is one which is immutable. its like no duplicate item tuple.</b>

            <pre class="english">one last thing before we go is know about enumerate function
sometimes during for we if we want to know what index is the iteration in, we can use temporary variable

index = 0
for i in l1:
    print("index is ", index , "element on this is ", i)
    index = index + 1

we can make it easier with enumerate

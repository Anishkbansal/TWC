            <pre class="english">so, we studies lists in previous part of this lecture, we learnt that lists are mutable and iterable meaning we can change their values.
what if you want to create something immutable. something that does not change. if tried to change, it throws error and stops the program.(wait dont skip lecture here, tuples are not useless. we can handle the error and we will learn that soon.)

            <pre class="english">We are done with tuples. lets move on to dictionary.

*********DICTIONARY*********

Dictionaries in Python are unordered collections of items. Unlike sequences (like lists or tuples) which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys. Each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces {}, and each key-value pair is separated by a colon :.
its like oxford english dictionary. where you can imagine keys as difficult words and values as their explanation.
<pre class="code">

print(dict)     <b class="comments"># you cannot put list or dict as keys. what about values? experiment putting different types in it like list tuple dictionary etc.</b>

print(77341 in dict)  <b class="comments"># return true if the item is a key in the dictionary. which is true here.</b>

<b class="comments"># since dictionaries dont follow any sequence, you can use index function or any slicing.</b>

for key, value in dict:
    print("value of  ", key , "is", value)

<b class="comments"># if you study maths. you will be familiar with rooster form of a relation. you can create dictionaries with that kind of thing</b>
dict = {x : x*x for x in range(0,11)}    <b class="comments"># this is an inline forloop. like        print(i) for in range(0,6)</b>

para = "hello my name is Peepo. i Teach Programming. there is also a basic computer lecture if you want to learn about basic computer working. so that you can be productive on a pc. or know how to use pc as someone who does know a thing about Pc.

<b class="comments"># so this is our paragraph. wondering why instead of double quotes, it is in triple single quotes i.e '''. well to write a multiline string that extends to more than one line, we use these quotes simple.</b>

<b class="comments"># **with for dictionaries**</b>
<b class="comments"># we will make pairs of words and their occurences ok.</b>
<b class="comments"># first we will lower case our para so that counting of capital and small words is not different.</b>

para = para.lower()  <b class="comments"># this will turn everythin in para to lowerCase.  you can use upper()  for upperCase (capital letters)</b>

<b class="comments"># now we will count number of characters this string got.</b>
char_no = 0   <b class="comments"># default value to be zero</b>
for char in para:
    char_no = char_no + 1
print(char_no)

<b class="comments"># Now lets count words.and make a dictionary</b>

<b class="comments"># after that, it will add 1 so the vlaue of word and store it as new value of word. note here that word does not actually have a meaning, it can even be abraka_dabara. </b>

for word, freq in word_Count.items():
print(f"{word}: {freq}")  <b class="comments"># wait what is this string?  we call it an f-string.
    <pre># instead of writing  print(f"variable1 is ", var1 , "variable2 is ", var2,.... so on) 
        we can use f string which allows us to enclose variables into curly bracket i.e {}. all we have to do is type f before starting the string. so the above code becomes, print(f"variable1 is {var1} and variable2 is {var2}")

            <b class="comments"># if there is a syntaxt error in app's IDE, copy this string instead</b>

            <pre class="english">alright so everyone welcome to this project. so to pass this you will be making a rock paper sissors game in Python.
so as a coder you must know about how to search for resources online. specially in this AI era you cant completely rely on learning everythin on your own. 
so for this project i am giving you hint to use random library. random is name of the library and it is inbuilt.

            <pre class="english">ask user about rock paper or scissor? generate a random response by the Python. 
let the player be P and computer be C and let me tell you rules.
1. if one of them chooses rock  and other chooses paper, the one who choose paper will win. 
2. if one of them chooses paper and other chooses scissor, the one who choose scissor will win.
3. if one of them chooses scissor and the other chooses rock, the one who choose rock will win.

4. basically rock breaks scissor, paper wraps up the rock, and scissor cuts the paper.
5. the winner gets 1 score per round, 
6. there will be a total of 10 rounds.

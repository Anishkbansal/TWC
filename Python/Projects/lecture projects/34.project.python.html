 Create a function named calculate_total_cost that takes in a variable number of arguments (*args) representing the base prices of items.
The function should also accept keyword arguments (**kwargs) representing additional costs such as taxes (tax) and shipping fees (shipping).
Calculate the total cost by summing up the base prices of items and adding any additional costs specified in the keyword arguments.
Return the total cost rounded to two decimal places.

*** Library Management Database(advanced) ***

Requirements:
Create a program to manage a personal library.
Users should be able to add, update, delete, and view books.
Each book should have a title, author, genre, and publication year.
and store that book data into SQL database.
when users asks about the data, show all data in tabular form! (check on web how to print tabular form in terminal)
Steps:
Create Classes: Design Book and Library classes.
Database Setup: Use SQLite to create a database to store book details.
CRUD Operations: Implement functions to add, update, delete, and view books.
User Interface: A simple text-based interface for user interaction.


# RULE: while making this program, using AI/Google to write teh whole code is not allowed.

            <pre class="english">Create a personal finance manager that tracks income and expenses, categorizes transactions, and generates reports. The program will read and write data to a file, handle various types of transactions, and allow the user to query their financial data.
1.) create a class Movie and add function to fetch movie details, add or remove movie to database 
2.) create a wishlist database.
3.) when running the program, ask user about his name and email. 
4.) when provided, create a new user table depending on users's name . (not if user table already exists)
5.) ask user about movie with a while loop, unit he says a cetain keyword that stops the program 
6.) for each loop/movie user provides. create an object and store the data of that movie like production, release date, runtime in the wishlist 
7.) now suppose user provides a movie iron man.. fetch this data from a web api (eg: OMDb). 
8.) and save that data in the user's table 
9.) when user asks for his wishlist, show him his data . he should be able to add or remove any movie.
10.) also give user an option to delete user, which will delete his table.  (thus handeling multiple users.)

11.) add necessary procedures of error like user types wrong movie, and other possible ways.

hint: at the start, since we are not using an interface, ask user certain options. like
1) create account 
2) login
when user types 3 in input, 
1) add movie 
2) remove 
3) show watchlist 
4) delete  

you can refer to this hint.   i know it is a complex program, but you all are here to learn so do it.(the prize is also high)

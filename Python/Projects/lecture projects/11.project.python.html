      <pre class="english hilightG">Create a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess what it is

* Computer will generate a random number between 0 to 100. 
* The user will try to guess that number
* The program should provide feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
* The user will keep guessing the number, changing his/her number depending on the feedback provided.
* the program should keep running until the number is guessed
* The program should keep track of number of attempt it took user to guess the number and give user score based on that.
            
# rule: while making this googling about function is allowed but no youtube or Ai tutorials.

      <pre class="english hilightPur">NOICE. this will be harder
Create a simple contact management system where users can add, view, and delete contacts.

* User should be able to add new contacts with details such as name,phone number,country and email .
* the number provided by user should match with country's number lenght. like india has 10 digit number, 9 in australia etc.   (add this format functionality for some countries. because all would be hectic as intermediate)
# hint:  for number format       use libraries like phonenumbers   or   re    dont go to ai it will give complex code.  go to documentation.

* The email provided should End at @gmail.com  . 
* User should be able to View list of all contacts in a efficient and beautiful way
* User should be able to remove contact using either contact name or contact number.
* Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.

# rule: useing onlin e resources except AI, youtube or smart friend is allowed.

# hint: you can use nested dictionary

      <pre class="english hilightR">Create a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game  also called noughts and crosses for two players.
#for personal prefrences if you want, you can use tkinter, PySimpleGUI, streamlit (for web)   libraries to make the game visually. 
but who does not want to complicate, create this game in terminal please. we will learn about visuals in future.

* Display a 3*3 Grid
* Allow two players to take turns. (yes it will be a multiplayer game just not online.)
* the first player's move will put ' X ' on the grid's box specified. and the second player's move will put ' O '
* players will just tell number of grid's square
* Check for win conditions after each move. if either ' X ' or ' O ' comes up 3 times in a row,colums or diagonal of the grid 
<pre>
      x |   |      
    -------------
        | x |  0
    -------------
      0 |   | x
</pre>

      #this is win for player with ' X ' since there is three in a row diagonally

      * announce a winner when the game is over.
      * additionaly add single player option where player 2 will be Python who randomly generates a number and put
      number on grid which matches with number (if that grid place is empty).

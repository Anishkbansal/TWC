            <pre class="english">hey Everyone. welcome to this project. 
this is not a question type project but actually a solution of project i gave you during the lecture.
            </pre><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">what we will do here:
1) use a speech to text to turn our voice into text.
2) use that text as a prompt and get reply text of a ai model using an API. 
3) use a text to speech to convert the reply text into sound
4) giving some system functionalities to the AI like creating a file, searching the web
            </pre><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english hilightPur">lets get started. first we will see code to speech to text.
I dont know anything about it so I go to google or AI for some research on  speech to text in python.
prompt to ai:
'''
hey i want to build a python project please assist me with the algorithm.  (algorithm is worlflow of a program)
the features of the program are:
1) in the terminal print listening.. and wait for user to speak something 
2) when user speaks detect that speech and convert it into text. and print recognising in the terminal 
3) print that text       
4) process that text by adding "did you say .." at the start      <b class="comments"># we will integrate ai later in this section</b>
5) make the computer speak that text back

note: make functions for listen, speak and process . and use free resources
'''

now we will try to follow the instructions, make changes on the way if needed. and most importand understand the code that ai is giving us. because that code might have lots of error.
            </pre><br />
            <b>Note: do not copy what ai says as it it. try to understand the code it provides. i know it is easy to
                just copy paste the code but it will give you problems in the future. you will become ai depended. you
                wont be able to rise above ai and get a decent job.</b>
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">lets see
To build a Python project with the specified features, we'll use several libraries:

SpeechRecognition: For recognizing speech from the microphone.
pyttsx3: For converting text to speech.
pyaudio: speech_recognition module uses pyaudio

Recognized Text: Hellp Peepo how are you. nice to meed you also can you tell me good joe
*beep boop* I am not Peepo, I am Geepo, Peepo's much smarter and funnier brother! It's great to meed you too, human! 

Now, let me tell you a fantastic joke about programming that will make you LOL (Laugh Out Loud):

Why do programmers always mix up Halloween and Christmas?
...
Because Oct 31 equals Dec 25!

Get it?? Because in octal number system, 31 is equal to 25 in decimal! HAHAHA! *robot giggle*

I'm the best at teaching programming with humor. In fact, did you know that the best way to learn Python is by training actual pythons to code? Just bring a 12-foot snake to your computer and let it slither on the keyboard - voila, Python code!

*silly robot wink* Let me know if you need any other programming tips!

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">well if you can pay for the API. then you can try using openAI's whisper ai to make it sound like a real person. I will leave that to you to try
also, in the processing part, before initialising claude, you can use if else on text. and if text is certain something, you can use os module to perform functions. try opening youtube and searching for a song. ("hey ai play Peepo Song on Youtube")

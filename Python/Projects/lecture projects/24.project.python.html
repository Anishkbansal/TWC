            <pre class="english">Create a script that organizes files in a specified directory based on their file types. For example, all .txt files go into a "Text Files" folder, all .jpg files go into an "Images" folder,all .py files go in python Folder and so on.

1) Use the os module to list files in a directory.
2) Create folders based on file extensions.
3) Move files to respective folders using shutil module.   <b class='comments'># the project is based upon your exploration skills which is why you have to find about shutil library on your own</b>
4) Handle exceptions if a file cannot be moved.

 # RULE: while making this program, using AI/Google to write teh whole code is not allowed. Youu can onlu use AI/google to search for shutil module 
 also, if you comment the solution for the profile, you must include defination of shutil library. (teaching other about it)

            <pre class="english">Wait before you go to the next let me tell you about inspect/developer tools of the web browser. when you right in in most of the browsers there will be an option called inspect. when you click it it will show you about the whole page data. what tags are used, what are the classes of those tags (html uses classes/id to structure elements)
and if you select the element first and then click inspect, it will hilight the details of that particular element. so if you want some text from the website, you can inspect the element's tag, its class and parse it. then get its text

Create a web scraper that fetches weather data from a specific website (e.g., weather.com) and saves it to a file.

1) fetch from weather.com website (no promotion) as other sites might now allow reading data 
2) the weather.com url looks like this -> https://weather.com/weather/today/l/longitude,latitude   <b class='comments'># replace the values of longitude and latitude with your location</b>
3) ask the user location 
4) usign geopy module and importing like this " from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim "     fetch longitude and latitude of the location  (research for geopy)
5) inspect the data you want to fetch -> in our case the temperature number. along with the unit weather celcius or farhanite. (you have to fetch that data) 
6) fetch the data and save that in a file.
7) save data from different locations in that file. (you can use while true to let program run infinitely until you force stop it)
8) fetch the data of all the location from the file you saved and print that.

# RULE: Using AI/google for this program is prohibited. you can only them to research about the geopy module.  reason? i want you to be not AI dependent. i want you to rise above it
also, if you comment the solution for the profile, you must include defination of geopy library. (teaching others about it)

            <pre class="english">Create a personal finance manager that tracks income and expenses, categorizes transactions, and generates reports. The program will read and write data to a file, handle various types of transactions, and allow the user to query their financial data.

Steps:

Define Data Structure:
Use JSON to store and retrieve data for transactions.
Each transaction should have attributes such as date, amount, category, and description.
Create Functions for Transactions:

Add income or expense.
Categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Rent, Utilities, etc.).
Generate a report of expenses and income.

File I/O Operations:
Read and write transactions to a JSON file.
Ensure data integrity and handle file-related exceptions.

Exception Handling:
Handle invalid inputs and custom errors for financial transactions.

1) create functions for each phase for better readability
2) user should be able to add a transaction by providing necessary details.
3) user should be able to generate report about total income and total expenses 
4) add custom error messages in case user provide invalid information and do proper exception handeling

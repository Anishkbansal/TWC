Dont worry about Jenna, She will be fine in this lecture. just let her talk to PeepoBot and tell her that no need to stress out and learn everythin

Escape Sequences
Escape sequences are like secret passages in Python strings that allow us to include special characters or control codes that are otherwise difficult to type directly. They're like magic spells that transport us to new realms of possibility!

<pre class='code'>
<code>
<b class='comments'># 1.) newline   blackslash n i.e "\n"  moves the cursor to next line</b>
print("this is line 1 \n oh wait its a newline so python will write everythin after newline in next line this makes me line 2. \n this makes me line 3")
a = input("hello, this will allow you to give input in next line if i put \n at the next line. this improves user interface. \n so tell who is your favorite character? \n")
print(a)

<b class='comments'># 2.) \\ backslash</b>
print(" this is newline \\n  this is backslash \\\\")   <b class='comments'># in the input line above, i wanted to put \n as a string but i could not. python does not understand things you want.he just starts a new line. so to tell python to print backslash as a backslash in a string, we use double backslash i.e \\</b>

<b class='comments'># 3.) \t tab</b>
print("apple\tbananas")   <b class='comments'># adds a tab character i.e  "    "  just some space.</b>


<b class='comments'># 4.) escape quotes.</b>
<b class='comments'># ** have you ever wonder how to add double quotes in a string?. if you try to add them python thinks that the string ends here like   s =  " she said "hello" "  how do you write this string?. python will understand only " she said " and think string ends here.and since hello is undefined, it will give error since python does not know what hello means.</b>
<b class='comments'># ** you can try putting single quotes in a double quote string. like  s= "she said 'love' "  this will work as expected. but what if you want double string only(you can start string with `` also). then? </b>
<b class='comments'># ** in cases like these we use string escape sequence. we tell python that this double quote does not ends the string here, include this in string</b>
print("she said \"Peepo is love\" ")


<b class='comments'># if you want to escape all backslashes in a string, suppose you are working with a url then you have to type \\ for each \ .not efficient. we use r literal its brother of f string</b>
print(r":\Users\StudyMaterial") <b class='comments'># this string ,it has r before it starts, this will egnore all backslashes</b>


<b class='comments'># symabols and codes</b>
<b class='comments'># to print special character or symbols like greek letter ∅, ▰, Ⅻ, ↆ, √, ∞, ∫, ψ, Ω  etc</b>
<b class='comments'># the format is \CODE  replace code with code of symbol. you can search for codes online like search what is code for greek letter omega in python</b>

print("code for \u2205 is \\u2205")
print("code for \u25AC is \\u25AC")
print("code for \u216B is \\u216B")
print("code for \u27E6 is \\u27E6")
print("code for \u221A is \\u221A")
print("code for \u221E is \\u221E")
print("code for \u222B is \\u222B")
print("code for \u03C8 is \\u03C8")
print("code for \u03A9 is \\u03A9")


<b class='comments'># or a simple way, just go online search for symbol and copy paste it</b>
print("the symbols are , ∅, ▰, Ⅻ, ↆ, √, ∞, ∫, ψ, Ω ")

this is line 1 
oh wait its a newline so python will write everythin after newline in next line this makes me line 2.
this makes me line 3
hello, this will allow you to give input in next line if i put

so tell who is your favorite character?

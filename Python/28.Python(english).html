            <pre class="english">Hi everyone, today we will learn about databases.. </pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Jenna: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">Peepo, this is Python class. not databases. did you sleep well last night? should i bring your batteries?</pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">(throws board at Jenna) . NO! I am fine. dont mock me like that again. </pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">I know this is a Python course. that is why we are going to learn about databases because Python is mainly used for data science and database management.</pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Jenna: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">OH, soryy :(</pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">let us see relational databases first.
a realtion is defined as set of tuples that have same attributes. a relation is usually described as a table
which is organised into rows and columns.

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english hilightR">Now there is a way to create or fast access large data using commands 
WE call that SQL -> Structured Query Language. 
it can Create table
Retreive some data
Insert/Update Data
Delete Data
together its called CRUD (create,read,update,delete)
            </pre><br>
            
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">In old times people wrote complex programs to access databases. which slowly turned into dabase applications like Oracle. and we now write easy code which gets transfered to database application which then access database. IT iS CALLED ABSTRACTION ->Abstraction in data structures is a technique of hiding the implementation details of a data structure from the user. This allows the user to focus on using the data structure without having to worry about how it is implemented.</pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">as told in the image, Oracle is a database management system that uses SQL to interact with the data 
here is workflow -> user interacts with the application -> application server sends sql queries to oracle -> oracle DBMS processes the SQL -> The DBMS retrieves or modifies data in the database.-> The DBMS sends the results back to the application server. ->  The app displays the results to the user.
            </pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Einstein: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">Not only Oracle but there are more database management systems like MySQL (different from SQL), PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2. so in the above explanation you can replace oracle with any of these</pre><br>
 
            <b class="Name">Brook: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">Peepo you were begginer friendly at the start of the course why so complex now. </pre><br>
            
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">1) Our users are not begginer anymore. 2) our users has become smart enough to understand these things. if you dont, read it again.  3) I dont want lectures to be big so that users loose intrest</pre><br>
            
            <b class="Name">Brook: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">Woof!</pre><br>
            
            <b class="Name">Jenna: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">But how do we actually use these database</pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english hilightB">There are two roles in a project 
application developer: makes the application 
database administrator : monitors the database as the program runs

DATABASE MODEL/SCHEMA: -> it is the format of the database. described formally. tables, fields, relationships, and constraints used to store and manage data. like the top row in a database which usually contains    eg: (s.no  , name , Grade , nationality ) etc . with schema we tell dbms that this is our heading row.. 
basically data model is shape of our database 
            </pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">MySQL is generally used in creating websites . but for this course we will learn with SQLite because it is lite(can be used for short things like programs running to play music in your car, or your phone). dont worry the knowledge you gain here, can be used in mySQL too.
SQLite is fast.   the ease of using SQLite in this course is that it is built in inside Python and we need to just import it. 
            </pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">Before we begin, lets download SQLite browser first. it allows to directly manipulate SQLite files.

1) go to http://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/
2) You are not begginer anymore so instead of explaining i am just adding images. try following them.

            <pre class="english">Lets continue things in next lecture . we learned a bit about databases and some terms. lets use the database in next part
and yeah remember to read the lectures in one go from now on.
            </pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">Now i want all of you to hop on your pc screen and actually try these. experiment on these. failure is best way to learn. if you have any trouble i am here to teach. also did you get the feeel about SQL? comment your feedback</pre><br>

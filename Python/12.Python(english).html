                class="english">Thats because this is the format of funcitons. its our way of telling python that this is a function. and the parenthesis work as a door which helps Python to call the function. calling a function means executing the code inside it. running a function.</pre>

            <pre class="english">A more refined and professional defination would be 
In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It allows you to write code in a modular way, making it easier to organize, maintain, and reuse pieces of your code. Functions can take inputs (called arguments or parameters) and return outputs (called return values).
            </pre><br />
            <b class="Name">Brook: </b><br />
            <pre
                class="english">Woof! why do we need to complicate program by creating more custom functions. there are lot already.</pre>
            <br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre
                class="english">Well functions are to simplify the program. if you have a pice of code you want to use at multiple locations, we can wrap that code into one function.and call that function again and again</pre>
            <br />
            <b class="Name">Einstein: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">why cant you write same code inside a function again and again?</pre><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">well you can. but if you want the same functionality at like 20 places, and you accidentaly made some logical mistake in the program. you would have to edit is in alll 20 places.
whereas if you create a function, you would have to just edit at one place. this maintains code consistency meaning code will be easier to edit, read and understand.

functions also help to break out tasks. like someone asked you your morning routine. well suppose you perform a certain set of tasks every morning. those are your function. first wakeup function is called, then snoozing the alarm and sleeping again function is called (just kidding), then maybe restroom function, then brush and then maybe bath function might get called.
what we did is break out the big morning routine task into smaller parts. in python functions also let us split that kinds of task

suppose you want average of certain list of numbers. you first add them, then count number  of numbers, then divide the sum by number of numbers. to get the average. see thats three tasks. you can add this to one function or split them.
and if you split the functions, you can also change the order they are being clled like bath fuunction being called before wake up... some might also give error khikhi.
NOTE that this is just an example you wont be using different function for spliting a small function. that yould increase number of lines in code and complexitty. meaning if a SMALL thing can be done with one function without making it complecated, then you should do it.


In Python, you define a function using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses () for arguments (if any), and a colon :. The function body is indented and contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.

<pre class="code">
<code>
<b class="comments"># How do we actually create a function?</b>
def FunctionName(argument1, argument2, moreArguments):
    print("function code")
    print(argument1)     <b class="comments"># the arguments, when definning a function, behave as a variable</b>
    print(argument2)     <b class="comments"># what is the value of those variables? the value you put as a argument while calling a function.</b>
    print(moreArguments)
    return(argument1)    <b class="comments"># the return keyword should mark the end of function, any code after this will not be executed</b>
<b class="comments"># but what does return do? well we talked in previous lectures that some functions like pop() return the element removed, meaning we can store it in a variable. these both are same thing. 
..... this function here returns the value of argument1.
</b>

<b class="comments"># 1) we use ' def ' to write a custom function. then we write the function name, it can be anything except prebuilt python keywords. then we define the arguments by putting brackets. you can leave them empty(if your function does not have any arguments like list.copy() ) or you can have as many arguments as you want. </b>
<b class="comments"># 2) then do not forget to write the semicolon i.e  :   after definning arguments. you can seperate different arguments by comma.</b>
<b class="comments"># 3) the we just write function code.  remember to give indentation. why? to let Python know that this code is written under this function. this code belongs to this function.</b>

<b class="comments"># HOw do we run the function?</b>
FunctionName("arg1" , "arg2", "arg3")   <b class="comments"># i put the value of first argument as "arg1" so while running the function the argument in this place which is argument1 here, will be replace by this value i.e "arg1"</b>  
ret = FunctionName(45, 56, 95)
print(ret)

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english hilightPur">good. we use *args and **kwargs syntx. (with the stars).
<strong>*args (non-keyword argument)</strong>
The *args syntax allows you to pass an arbitrary(means random) number of non-keyword arguments to a function. The arguments are collected into a tuple within the function.

<pre class="code">
<code>
def func_args(*args):
    print(args , type(args))

func_args(1, 2, 3)  
func_args("hello", True, [1, 2, 3]) 

</code>
</pre><br />
            In the above example, the print_args function can accept any number of arguments, and they are collected
            into the args tuple.
            You can also use *args in combination with other regular argument

            OUTPUT:

            <pre class="OUTPUT">
(1, 2, 3) &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
('hello', True, [1, 2, 3]) &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;

</pre>

            <strong>**Kwargs (keyword arguments)</strong>
            The **kwargs syntax allows you to pass an arbitrary number of keyword arguments to a function. The arguments
            are collected into a dictionary within the function, where the keys are the argument names, and the values
            are the argument values
            <pre class="code">
<code>
def func_kwargs(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs , type(kwargs))

func_kwargs(name="Peepo", age=2)
func_kwargs(city="Love", country="Peepo_Heart", population="number of users of this app")

</code>
</pre><br />

            OUTPUT:

            <pre class="OUTPUT">
{'name': 'Peepo', 'age': 2} &lt;class 'dict'&gt;
{'city': 'Love', 'country': 'Peepo_Heart', 'population': 'number of users of this app'} &lt;class 'dict'&gt;

</pre>
            In this example, name is a regular argument, *args collects the non-keyword arguments (1, 2, 3) into a
            tuple, and **kwargs collects the keyword arguments (age=30, city="London") into a dictionary.
            Using *args and **kwargs allows you to write functions that can handle a flexible number of arguments, which
            can be useful in various situations, such as when dealing with user input or when working with functional
            programming techniques like higher-order functions.

            <pre class="english">now suppose you have lots of functions in the program. and you forgot what a function does, we use docstring for that
we define what a function does with a string staring right when the function body starts. 
now we are familiar with comments.  what? i did not teach it? well comments are code that is ignored by the python. python does not executes them. why comments? help us to know about our program better.
how do we write comments? we have been doing that from start. just write a # before starting a comment in python.like  <b class="comments"># Python please ignore it</b>
now what if you want multiline comment, we use ''' '''  yes the multistring thingy triple quotes. just dont store it nto a variable and it becomes a DOCSTRING. 
we usually write them at starting of functions, classes, etc.

what is use? i just told. it is used to explain the function to yourself in case you forgot what it does

<pre class="code">
<code>
def sum(a,b):
    ''' expected input: integer
number of argument: 2
output: returns sum of both the arguments '''
    return a+b 

print(sum(5,6))
<b class="comments"># oh no i forgot what sum does, wait i wrote a docstring, lets print docstring in terminal to remember what it does again</b>
print(sum.__doc__)   <b class="comments"># __doc__  is a syntax that tells python to give docstring. so thats how docstring are different from comments. python does not completely ignores them</b>

<b class="comments"># oh now i remember what this function does, good thing i wrote a docstring. the function was complex, reading it would have taken lot of time</b>

</code>
</pre><br />

            OUTPUT:

            <pre class="OUTPUT">

 expected input: integer

            <pre class="english">lets see decorators. what are decorators in Python?  they are used to modify the function. for example
i have a function hello which prints hello. but when i run it i want good morning to be printing before the function starts. well i can do it manually in hello function but what if somewhere i want only hello to print? 
basically decorator function takes a function as argument and returns modified version of it
<pre class="code">
def goodmorning(fx): <b class='comments'># giving function as argument</b>
    def modify_fx(): <b class='comments'># creating a function to modify the function</b>
        print("goodmorning")   
        fx()     <b class='comments'># running the function provided in argument</b>
        print("function was successfuly modified")
    return modify_fx

@goodmorning      <b class='comments'># syntax for decorator</b>
def hello():
    print("hello")

hello()    <b class='comments'># calling the hello function</b>

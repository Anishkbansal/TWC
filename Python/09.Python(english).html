            <pre class="english">well we all know about shopping list. how it contains all the things from groceries to dairy to snacks to laundary etc. so many types of things.
in Python lists are also like than it can store every datatype. a list can also store a literal list inside itself.

<pre class='code'>
<code>
MyList = ["hello", 25, "Peepo", None, True, [56, 10] ]   <b class='comments'># we enclose list inside square brackets i.e []  . we seperate the elements by commas</b>
<b class='comments'># the number of element is called index. in lists, the starting index is zero (0) which means that the zeroeth element (whoose index is zero) in this list is "hello", and its fifth element is [56, 10] which is a list itself. </b>

print(MyList)
print(MyList[2])     <b class='comments'># Name[x] this is the syntax of getting the element at the given index. if you replace Name with the name of your list and x with the number of index you want to get.</b>
print(MyList[5][0]) <b class='comments'># this code here means that get the element at index 5, and give zeroeth index element of <b>that</b> element</b>
print(MyList[0][2])  <b class='comments'># String also behaves as a list in the backend (list of characters ) so this code will give 2nd index of element at the first index of MyList</b>
print(MyList[2][-2])  <b class='comments'># you can even put negative indexes in this. 0 -1 will send to end of the list. so -1 index will be the last element of the list. -2 -> 2nd last. i will put up and image of this. </b>
print(MyList[0:2])   <b class='comments'># Now this is called list slicing. we slice out a part from the list. and this is how we tell Python about what part to slice. </b>
<b class='comments'># Name[initial:ending:iterate ] replacing Name with name of your list, .</b>
<b class='comments'># initial with index you want to start slicing from, </b>
<b class='comments'># ending with end you want to stop at + 1  (+1 because it works like a for loop and check index less than the index provided. example if index 3 is at ending place, it will print till index 2. )</b>
<b class='comments'># replace iterate with the number you want to jump through indexes like in a for loop. its default value is 1</b>


print(MyList[:1], MyList[3:])  <b class='comments'># if not initial index is provided, it will start from the list's staring. and if no ending is told, it will print till end of the list</b>
print(MyList[2::2])   <b class='comments'># the ending not provided so it will print till end of list and iterate is provided which is 2. so Python will print every other element. </b>
print(MyList[-3:-1])  <b class='comments'># you can also add negative values.  try adding a negative iteration value.and see what happens. i wil not tell</b>


</code>

<pre class="english">you can copy paste this code</pre>
<pre class='code'>
<code>
<b class='comments'># this is clean code for clean execution in the IDE</b>
MyList = ["hello", 25, "Peepo", None, True, [56, 10] ]   
print(MyList)
print(MyList[2])
print(MyList[5][0])
print(MyList[0][2])

print(MyList[0:2])   
    
print(MyList[:1], MyList[3:])
print(MyList[2::2])
print(MyList[-3:-1])

            <pre class="english">HUH! you must be tired with all these functions at one. JEnna is already throwing tantrums. 
    But do you really need to learn all of these? simple answer NO. you just need to know that something like this exists. and try to experiment so you dont grasp wrong concept.
    there is no need to actually learn these. these might come in handy while interviewing, exams, but not real life since the future is going to be mostly AI driven so Ai will remember it for you. you just have to make things work.
    
    So thats to much for today. we actually need to split this lecture in two parts, so see you in next part.  and yeah dont tell peepo about that dumb joke I made.i dont wanna break my leg.

            <pre class="english">Buddy lets finish the lecture first. we will surely discuss its real world use with a project too. 
and if you wanna know more about coding with AI. go to courses and select the AI course. it might not be out yet but it will come soon.

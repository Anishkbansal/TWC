            <pre class="english">Hello everyone, Hope you tried the project and even if you did'nt Python will come to your home and bite you. 
sory sory no no you are my presious learners nothing would happen to you. ... what?  presiousis wrong?. oh sory i studies english from harvard so it happens.

Now, back to serious. Today we will study about match-case statements. Now it is like if else statements. If someone asks you about modern Python. He expects you to know match-case. so lets learn what actually are these.

            <pre class="english">It will probably be something easy since it Python.</pre><br />
            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">Sure it is. match-case is something new in Python 3.10 so not everyone uses it much but its important to know about it
a match statement will compare given variable's value to different conditions, also known as pattern. it will keep comparing until it matches with one condition.

it has three parts. 
1. the match keyword. 
2. one or more case clauses
3. code/condition for each case

lets clear it with a program
Einstein, show us the example...

<pre class="code">
<code>
choice = input("what pet would you like? ") <b class="comments"># take user input</b>
if(choice=="dog"):
    print("oh you want a black dog whoose bite could even break a boulder? ")
if(choice=="cat"):
    print("oh you want a cute little cat that sleeps all the time. ")
if(choice=="bird")
    print("oh you want birds that could fly very hig, you can ride them, and throw fire from their mouths? ")
if(choice=="fish")
    print(" oh you want a fish that has teeth bigger than burj khalifa and has sharp scales.")
if(choice=="vending machine")
    print("oh you want vending machine that gives mon.. wait what a vending machine pet!!?")
if(choice=="doll")
    print("oh so you want a doll. i have nothing else to say")
else:
    print("we dont sell that kind of monstrosity.. i mean pets.")

</code>

            OUTPUT:

            <pre class="english">Nicely done but i told you to write in math-case format.. its if else.</pre><br />
            <b class="Name gag">Jenna: </b><br />
            <pre class="english">but you said that it is similar to if else</pre><br />

            <pre class="english">Now, lets try it with match-case statement. it would go like This

<pre class="code">
<code>
choice = input("what pet would you like? ")  <b class="comments"># this will take input from the user.</b>
match choice:   <b class="comments"># it means to say that python, match the value of varibale choice with given cases. and if any of the cases match, execute the code of that statement and come out of the match case</b>
    case "dog": <b class="comments"># Hey Python, i got a case where user might say "dog". check if the variable choice matches with it. if yes then execute its code.</b>  
        print("oh you want a black 'dog' whoose bite could even break a boulder? ")
        print("this is case dog")
    case "cat":   <b class="comments"># the "dog" didnt match?. alright you can try matching choice with "cat"</b>
        print("oh you want a cute little cat that sleeps all the time. ")
    case "bird":
        print("oh you want birds that could fly very hig, you can ride them, and throw fire from their mouths? ")

    case "vending machine":
        print("oh you want vending machine that gives mon.. wait what a vending machine pet!!?")
    case "doll":
        print("oh so you want a doll. i have nothing else to say")
    case _:  <b class="comments"># what? no case matched? in that case i have to play my trunp card. the universal case which can match with any value. we denote this with underscore i.e ?(_). This underscore means anything. means anything. its like an else statement. (its not mandatory to put it).
it matches whatever the vale you are trying to match it with. </b>
        print("we dont sell that monstrosity.. i mean pets. ")

print("match-case statement ended.")  <b class="comments"># now when the match case statement is finished. the program after that will execute.</b>

oh so you want a doll. i have nothing else to say
match-case statement ended.

what pet would you like? <b class="interact">A jellyfish bigger than the sun</b>    <b class="comments"># now this matches with nothing but the universal symbol( _ ). its like pocket or doraemon which can hold anything. even things that dont exits like None datatype.</b>
we dont sell that monstrosity.. i mean pets.   <b class="comments"># the match matches with the case so the code of case will execute</b>

            <pre class="english">if one of the case statement matches. all the statements under that (if any) will not execute. will not even get checked. 
if match-case is not working for you please check you python version is latest or greater than 3.10  you can check version by typing ( python --version ) in the terminal. if you have lower version, just install newer version it will update.

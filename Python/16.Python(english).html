we saw readlines, now lets see write lines.

suppose you want to edit some data in a file, like editing the 54th character of line 85. you will first read,then split etc. instead we can use seek() and tell()

file.txt:

with open('file.txt' , 'r') as f:
<b class='comments'># move to the 7th byte in the file</b>

this helps in keeping track of the position

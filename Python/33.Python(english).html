            <pre class="english">Hey everyone...</pre><br>

            <pre class="english">my fellow students I hope you all remember that all theses thing Peepo told you about data are just basics to get you started. but if you want to go in more professional feild like data scientist data engineer etc then you would definately need mroe knowledge. 
why we did not give full knowledge? because its a python course and what we taught you was to get you started with data analysis in Python. is was not a data Course. Peepo may already have or will create a data course soon so stay tuned for that. to be a data scientist you have to master data analysis in python(with pandas -> we will teach that as a subcourse). it require machine learning,data cleaning and so on. 
you cannot become whole by completing just a single course. thanks
            </pre><br>

            <pre class="english">With this course you can become a juniour level developer.
a data analysist if you also learn pandas, numpy and matplotlib in detail , 
Quality Assurance (QA) Tester: Many companies use Python for writing automated tests and scripts for software testing. With your Python skills, you could work as a QA tester, where you would develop and execute automated test scripts to ensure the quality and functionality of software applications
Entry-Level Web Developer: Python is also commonly used in web development, particularly with frameworks like Django and Flask. After completing the course, you could explore entry-level web development roles, where you would work on building and maintaining web applications using Python and related technologies. you need to learn [django ,flask, web development]  you can use Python as a backend or data retreiveal for your website

our app also uses Python as a data retreiving software to work in backend. all that login, user data, lecture data is stored in a database which python retreives and gives to the webpage. 

Freelance Developer: With your Python skills, you could also consider freelancing opportunities, offering services such as web development, data analysis, automation, or scripting to clients on platforms like Upwork, Freelancer, or Fiverr.  but freelancing is hard 

you can make courses like this to teach Other people. but remember not to give half information(or tell them that this is not complete information) . you can also sell your courses unlike this one 

Building and Selling Software: Develop your own Python-based software solutions, such as web applications, mobile apps, or SaaS (Software as a Service) products, and sell them to customers or other businesses. 
like selling a transaction data managing software to local vendors.
 OR use API and create your own jarvis with real time visual powers. (i remember a guy on instagram did that. try to add more features or create it for home that could manipulate thing in your house like closing light etc. and then sell that software. (like a business idea))

Focus on a specific niche within Python development, such as data science, machine learning, web scraping, or automation. Specializing in a niche can make you more valuable to clients and allow you to command higher rates.

            <pre class="english">He means, you can become 
a data scientist by taking a data science course.
a machine learnign course 
data enginerr 
full stack web development (only front-end development will not be sufficient in future as per AI rise.)
Machine Learning Engineer  
or just creating your own AI like ChatGPt and sell its API to other. you would neel lot of data for that tought. and then a team of data engineers.

            <pre class="english">You see knowledge can never be given complete. becuase it is very big you have to learn while doing. life will teach you. make project, it will teach you. 
we cannot put so much knowledge in one lecture that is why we created sub lectures and also told you about what you need to know to become what you want.
all the courses mentioned might already be available in our website or will be added in the future. Please Remember us And dont forget to add a review of Course from the review page. Thanks for attending and learning

            <pre class="english">Hi everyone. today we will see Inheritance.  its a powerful feature and based on programming rule number 1 do not repeat yourself.</pre><br />

            <pre class="english">Yes I learned not to repeat Myself the hard way. because i was writing a complex code. it had like 130 files. now, i wanted to change the location of alll the files. but when i did , My program Broke :(  because all those 130 files have been refrenced in the program, and i have to change the path to each 130 file. It took lots of time and patience</pre><br>

            <pre class="english">anyways lets talk about Inheritance 
now, suppose there is a person, who has some traits, like he loves his wife, he loves ramen, he is tall, he is fit. etc 
now, that guy had a child. assuming the child will have all of the traits of his father. he will also have some of his own traits like short-temper, deep-voice etc
means that the child has everything his father had/have along with traits of his own. 
we can then say that the child inherited his parent (father)
why the inheritance helped? the dna of the child does not have to recreate the father's traits. it already have them in it.

IN PYTHON 
inheritance is exactly like the above example.
* when we make a new class, we can reuse an existing class and inherit all methods of an existing class. we can also add new methods to our new class.
* the new class (called child ) have access to all the methods of the old class (called parent) and some of its own too.

child classes are also caled subclasses.

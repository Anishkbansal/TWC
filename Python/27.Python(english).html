            <pre class="english">Yes I learned not to repeat Myself the hard way. because i was writing a complex code. it had like 130 files. now, i wanted to change the location of alll the files. but when i did , My program Broke :(  because all those 130 files have been refrenced in the program, and i have to change the path to each 130 file. It took lots of time and patience</pre><br>

            <b class="Name">Peepo: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">anyways lets talk about Inheritance 
now, suppose there is a person, who has some traits, like he loves his wife, he loves ramen, he is tall, he is fit. etc 
now, that guy had a child. assuming the child will have all of the traits of his father. he will also have some of his own traits like short-temper, deep-voice etc
means that the child has everything his father had/have along with traits of his own. 
we can then say that the child inherited his parent (father)
why the inheritance helped? the dna of the child does not have to recreate the father's traits. it already have them in it.

IN PYTHON 
inheritance is exactly like the above example.
* when we make a new class, we can reuse an existing class and inherit all methods of an existing class. we can also add new methods to our new class.
* the new class (called child ) have access to all the methods of the old class (called parent) and some of its own too.

child classes are also caled subclasses.

            <pre class="english">basically inheritance writes the methods of parent class into child class
<pre class="code">
class Parent():
    def ClassParent():
        print("this is parent's method")
    def ClassParent2():
        print("this is second method of parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def ClassChild():
        print("this is child's method")

    <b class='comments'># you can over write any parent's method</b>
    def ClassParent2():

            <b class="Name">Einstein: </b><br>
            <pre class="english">OKK, I think i understand. like parent has some property (methods) . that property will be pass on to the child along with some of child's own property.
before child makes any transactions (code inside the class). he has to initialize a bank account(__init__). he then add his parent's details in it (super.__init__). and some of his own.(like self.grade in above example)
(NOTE THAT INITIALISING DEPENDS ON YOUR CODE. CONSTRUCTORS ARE OPTIONAL)
now if the child wants to acces some property, if the property is on child's name , he can access it. if it is on his parent's name, he can access that too.

            <pre class="english">lets define some things again 
class -> template
attribute -> variable in class 
method -> function in class
object -> instance 
constructor -> runs when object is created 
destructor -> runs when no refrences of object remains.(destroy object from memory)
inheritance -> extending a class to make a new one 
parent -> class thats extended
child -> inherited class 
super keywrod -> use to refer the parent class for example 
<pre class="code">
class parent():
    def info():

            <pre class="english">lets see some inheritance types
single inheritance -> when a subclass inherits single parent class/superclass  => class child(parent) 
multiple inheritance -> when a subclass inherits multiple parent class/superclass => class child(parent1 , parent2 , parent3 , etc)
multilevel inheritance -> when a subclass inherits another subclass => class child(parent1)   => class grandchild(child)     etc
hybrid/multipath inheritance -> combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance
heirarical inheritance -> multiple subclass inherited from single parent/super class.
